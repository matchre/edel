The edel game in HTML/JS uses JQuery (and aight.js for IE8)You can change the grid folder path, search for "baseURL" in edel.jsTested on Firefox, Chrome, IE8+, Android, IphoneThe interaction on the mobile browser are a bit limited (no right click) so the game is like the Java version.In this new version you can tag empty cells with a right click and it is checked against the real value. In the older version it was just an indicator for yourself.The rules are not part of the actual game so you can put them where you want.Background image by Souzan Memari (souzan@memari.fr)
